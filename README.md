# policies

This repository is where Regen Foundation documents, publishes, and tracks our policies.

As a blockchain entity, we're committed to transparency. We want our tokenholders and other network stakeholders to be able to see the legal documents to which Regen Foundation is held to account, as well as being able to see who can edit them, and track what has changed and when. 

In this repository, you can find:
- By-Laws
- Conflict-of-Interest Policy
- Treasury Management Policy
- Financial Management Policy

Feel free to adopt these policies for your own use. For reference, Regen Foundation is a US-Based (Delaware) 501(c)(3) public charity non-profit. Of course, none of this can be constituted as legal advice!
