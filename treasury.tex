\title{TREASURY MANAGEMENT POLICY \protect\\ OF \protect\\ REGEN FOUNDATION}
\author{Adopted: March 3rd, 2021}
\date{} 
\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}
\item Layers of Defense
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multi-sig wallet: two out of three signatories to do anything
\begin{enumerate}
\item Key management policy around mnemonic backups and ledgers
\end{enumerate}
\item 21-day unbonding period
\begin{enumerate}
\item If monitoring is occurring, compromises can be identified before tokens become liquid
\end{enumerate}
\item If the assets compromised are significant enough, community governance can be addressed through a governance proposal $($such as during the original DAO hack on Ethereum in 2016$)$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation Token Endowment
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it This allocation is 5mm REGEN at Token Generation Event, and consists of “permanently-staked tokens.”}
\item Treatment of Staking Rewards
\begin{enumerate}
\item Staking rewards are held in a discretionary pool, disbursements governed by the Foundation Board
\item This policy will be revisited in 2022
\end{enumerate}
\item Delegation Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation will make staking decisions according to these criteria $($in no particular order$)$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Community engagement
\item Testnet scores
\item Validator professionalism and security protocols
\item Reputation in the ecosystem
\item Engagement with the utility of Regen Ledger as a part of Validator Business Operations
\end{enumerate}
\item Delegations are made on an annual basis, or redeligated in the case of emergencies, until which point more dynamic options are available
\item In addition to the criteria listed above, Regen Foundation will endeavor to maintain a well distributed delegation strategy aimed to decentralize staking power and rewards across the broadest set of validators that can credibly meet the above criteria. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Voting Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation will vote in alignment with its charitable cause, at its discretion
\item For Community Staking DAO allocation please see section II below. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Multi-Sig Wallet Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Directors have signed a policy elucidating the legal relationship they hold with the Foundation as signers
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hardware wallets and mnemonic keys are the property of the foundation.
\item Delegation decisions and transaction decisions will be made through a board vote, and the multi-sig will not be used as a voting mechanism, merely to execute transactions on behalf of the Foundation on Regen Ledger.
\end{enumerate}
\item Two out of three Board Directors must sign transactions/delegations
\item This policy will be revisited when groups module and keystone functionality allow delegated rights to create an equally secure but more efficient system.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Community Staking DAO
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it This allocation is 30mm REGEN at Token Generation Event, and consists of tokens to be enDAOed to permanently-staked pools.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item This pool is stewarded by the Foundation on behalf of future Community Staking Members
\end{enumerate}
Treatment of Staking Rewards
\begin{enumerate}
\item Staking Rewards are redelegated
\end{enumerate}
\item Delegation Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Delegations are made across a broad set of validators $($potentially the entire validator set$)$ using algorithmic criteria to balance amounts
\begin{enumerate}
\item Network-wide validator economics will be factor into this policy
\end{enumerate}
\item Delegations are made on an annual basis, or redeligated in the case of emergencies, until which point more dynamic options are available
\end{enumerate}
\item Voting Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation will not actively vote with these tokens
\item According to Tendermint consensus this means that the tokens will follow the Validator vote where the tokens are staked.  
\item Upon enDAOment the full rights accorded to the tokens will be under the control of the community staking DAO managing the private keys and they can vote as they see fit.
\end{enumerate}
\item Multi-Sig Wallet Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Directors have signed a policy elucidating the legal relationship they hold with the Foundation as signers
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hardware wallets and mnemonic keys are the property of the foundation.
\item Delegation decisions and transaction decisions will be made through a board vote, and the multi-sig will not be used as a voting mechanism, merely to execute transactions on behalf of the Foundation on Regen Ledger.
\end{enumerate}
\item Two out of three Board Directors must sign transactions/delegations
\item This policy will be revisited when Groups module and Keystone functionality allow delegated rights to create an equally secure but more efficient system.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation Cash
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cash donations received by the Foundation are held as cash at our account with Amalgamated Bank
\item Cash management strategies are expanded upon in our Financial Management Policy
\end{enumerate}
\item Other Assets
\begin{enumerate}
\item As the Foundation encounters other asset classes, it will develop treasury management for these asset classes.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
