\title{TREASURY MANAGEMENT POLICY \protect\\ OF \protect\\ REGEN FOUNDATION}
\author{Updated:}
\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation Token Endowment
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it This allocation is 5mm REGEN at Token Generation Event, and consists of locked tokens.}
\item Treatment of Staking Rewards
\begin{enumerate}
\item Staking rewards are held in a discretionary pool, disbursements governed by the Foundation Board
\item This policy will be revisited in 2022
\end{enumerate}
\item Delegation Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation will make staking decisions according to these criteria $($in no particular order$)$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Community engagement
\item Testnet scores
\item Validator professionalism and security protocols
\item Reputation in the ecosystem
\item Engagement with the utility of Regen Ledger as a part of Validator Business Operations
\end{enumerate}
\item Initial delegations have been made in advance of mainnet, and redelegations will likely occur within a month of mainnet, once adequate empirical data is available to inform this process.
\item In addition to the criteria listed above, Regen Foundation will endeavor to maintain a well distributed delegation strategy aimed to decentralize staking power and rewards across the broadest set of validators that can credibly meet the above criteria. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Voting Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation will vote in alignment with its charitable cause, at its discretion
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Community Staking DAO
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it This allocation is 30mm REGEN at Token Generation Event, and consists of tokens to be enDAOed to locked pools.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item This pool is stewarded by the Foundation on behalf of future Community Staking Members
\end{enumerate}
\item Treatment of Staking Rewards
\begin{enumerate}
\item Staking Rewards are redelegated
\end{enumerate}
\item Delegation Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two factors will affect delegation weight:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ranking in the validator set by total stake (bell curve distribution)
\item Commission (equalized for)
\end{enumerate}
\item 5mm of this allocation will be delegated per month until 5mm REGEN remain undelegated.
\item For more on the process of how this policy was developed, and for further details, see \href{https://regen.foundation/attending-to-stake-distribution-and-validator-economics/}{this post}.
\end{enumerate}
\item Voting Policy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation will not actively vote with these tokens
\item According to Tendermint consensus this means that the tokens will follow the Validator vote where the tokens are staked.  
\item Upon enDAOment the full rights accorded to the tokens will be under the control of the community staking DAO managing the private keys and they can vote as they see fit.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Regen Foundation Cash
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cash donations received by the Foundation are held as cash at our account with Amalgamated Bank
\item Cash management strategies are expanded upon in our Financial Management Policy
\end{enumerate}
\item Other Assets
\begin{enumerate}
\item As the Foundation encounters other asset classes, it will develop treasury management for these asset classes.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
